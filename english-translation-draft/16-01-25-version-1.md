## Warning
It has only been two years since our Venerable Master, departing the visible world, passed through the Gate of Souls to unite eternally with the Divine Verb, the angelic Soul, which was always—even if invisible—the support of his life here on Earth.

The disappearance of this luminous genius has caused a great number of disciples to spring up from every quarter, and we could not help but be pleased by this if some among them, recently convinced and exaggerating their neophytes’ zeal, did not attempt to persuade themselves and others that they are the true guardians of the Master’s highest confidences and the bearers of his innermost thoughts. It is unnecessary to add that they all profess a thorough knowledge of the Archeometer, yet its exact description, which we received from the very hands of its inventor, remains completely unpublished.

Some do not hesitate to give cabalistic interpretations of this instrument of interpretation.

Others, who do not blush when claiming deep knowledge of every secret of archeometric science, promise grand and illusory initiations that, by the grace of God, will never come to pass, except in their exalted imagination. Finally, others invoke Saint-Yves to spread to their readers ramblings of a very rudimentary and childish anti-clericalism and anti-papalism, worthy at best of a small-town sub-electoral committee or of a tenth-order lodge of the G∴ O∴, and which would have been enough for their authors—had the Master been alive—to earn one of those harsh words he kept in reserve.

Among those who have read and sincerely admired Saint-Yves, some have asked why his friends seemed to do so little to defend his memory. The explanation is simple. A being such as he, whose absence will always be felt, has no need of defense; even though dead on Earth, he remains powerful enough to defend himself, leaving behind sufficient unpublished works to silence all impostors.

This work is a magnificent example of that. It was published at the right time, chosen by the Master, and responds like thunder to all the insane slanders propagated after his death and concealed under his name.

A continuation and conclusion to *Les Missions* (“The Missions”), this book is truly an *Introduction to the Study of the Archeometer.* Never before, in his earlier works, had Saint-Yves set out so deliberately to unveil the core of his innermost thought; never, in any other work, had he so boldly examined the Mysteries; never had he revealed himself so completely.

We will not only recognize the Christian and renewing genius inspired by Sinarquy, but also the true successor of the ancient Nabis*, the last Prophet. A terrible flame runs throughout his work as a modern Isaiah—just as severe to contemporary Pharisees and scribes as Amos’s son was to the scholars and priests of Judah. His visions regarding the future of France and Europe—now fallen into the worst pagan anarchy—are terrifying; many have sadly already come to pass, others are on the way, and if we had not heard these prophecies read from the Master’s own mouth more than seven years ago, in front of the infinite sea, which conferred even more grandeur and majesty upon them, we might believe that they were written afterward.

Yet, at the same time that he depicts the imminent catastrophes for peoples subject to the implacable Laws of historical Cycles, his heart bleeds in the face of that fatality, which seems inevitable and yet could be avoided. He urges his human brothers to abandon the false Way and to follow the true Road, which he has been pointing out for over twenty years—and still indicates to us. Finally, he implores them to do so in an earnest attempt, for these are the only means capable of opposing Destiny and saving Humanity. And in that sense, he is a truly human being, for whom “nothing human is alien”—and that is not the least of his qualities, or the least of the reasons for our veneration and our profound affection.

It was around 1903, judging by certain allusions to events of that time, that the present work—which we are publishing today—was composed. Dispersed notes and completed texts were gathered with reverence, and we have acted strictly as mere coordinators. We inform the reader of this so that they may understand why in the appendix we have had to interrupt a fragment written in a form and style entirely different from those adopted for this work. And if we have preserved and published this unfinished fragment, it is because we are convinced it will be read with pleasure by all who knew the Master and studied him somewhat, for they will recognize in it his fine irony, his clever wit, and that marvelous blend of simplicity and elegance that brought so much charm and originality—and sometimes unpredictability—to his most lofty and serious conversations.

We shall not comment on the work’s form and division, for we believe they are quite clear, especially now that some plates of the Archeometer have been reproduced and disseminated everywhere.

## Preface
**Classical Studies; Their Influence. — The Hierarchies of Peoples. — Human Astronomy. — Athenians and Romans; Their Anarchic Character. — Origin of the Greeks. — Ancient Cycles. — The Metropolises. — Verbal Proto-Synthesis<sup>2</sup>. — Mediterranean Paganism. — The Invasions. — The Appearance of Pythagoras. — Our Present Time Compared to That of Pythagoras. — Why We Are Writing This Book.**

It has been five centuries since the birth of classical studies and three centuries since they have increasingly usurped European governments, leading them to successive detriment, for the benefit of America and Asia. From the crown princes down to scholarship students, there are fewer and fewer Christians; upon entering those inverted catacombs, they become more and more pagan.

The younger generations urgently need a second exit from that descent into the underworld, an exit for this country (France) out of the Darkness in which they enter rosy and leave pale. What is lacking is comparison, judgment, an initiation into true life, the healing of genuine Humanity, of celestial air, of divine light.

When these studies were published, we already suspected their spirit. Our higher studies led us to discover, despite this anarchy, the Teachings, the Universal Principle of knowledge and sociology whose laws of the State later became the subject of our historical demonstrations.

There are hierarchies among peoples, primarily among their guides, according to their original Essence and the graft they can bring.

As though governed by a human astronomy, these Guides reappear from era to era, from one people to another, illuminating darkness, removing obstacles, and guiding the courses of collectives.

They untangle, for a more or less extended period, depending on the nature of their surroundings, tangled distortions, imparting a general sense and a resurgence of destinies. They come at the right time to fulfill one of the functions we have described<sup>3</sup>, functions that draw upon and pull one another, like a system of gravitation.

Since Theocracy is the highest degree, peoples are always visited, at the right time, by a Guide of the first Order, who also has its degrees: Orpheus, Numa, Pythagoras. They are invited to participate as primary exponents of social life and civilization in order to find their own peace and to serve as an example to Humanity.

Our *Missions* prove that no one has admired the great men of all times more than we have, and consequently, the Greco-Latin ancestors. Yet we cannot say the same of the Athenians and Romans, declared opponents of those remarkable individuals. Indeed, never have we encountered more implacable adversaries of the Supreme Organism in all historical accounts than the Athenians and Romans. Human nature has never faced a more chaotic, incoherent, and essentially anarchistic individuality— a banal and individualistic mass, and thus all the more rebellious.

Their frantic atomicity has never been less susceptible to any molecular cohesion beyond what stems from the pressure of circumstances—represented by armed forces. It is a perpetual civil quagmire, suited for military regimentation or armed invasion.

It is then, to momentarily safeguard these environments, that a second-order Guide reappears, a secondary star in the human Astronomy. He is called Alexander and Caesar; and so that civil disorder does not swallow him there, his chief of staff compels him to devour the world.

The first Order was social; the second, political. One creates, the other preserves what exists, but it only changes the exterior. Intellectual and social decay remains within.

Thus, everything collapsed in the Late Byzantine Roman Empire because it was the continuation of the Babylonic activities. Europe was granted in fief to that antiquated memory, but it was not animated as in an adventure or scandalous novel. Thank God, that is not the norm of the long universal History, but a sequential series of declines, like the undulations of a serpent. The Athenians and Romans were not originally natives of those regions, but decadent refugees from elsewhere; in effect, they were nearly foreigners in those cities, especially in Greece and Italy.

Among the moderns, Archeology; among the ancients, Mythology—since, under the authority of the Indo-Egyptian Priest Universities, History, like other Sciences, was never written clearly but wrapped in enigmas—and finally the Sacred Books, allowed us to lift the veils of distant ages<sup>4</sup>.

We will never sufficiently honor the two Peninsulas that the mountain chains of the Balkans and the Alps connect to our continent. At every step we travel, we may say, *“Sta viator, heroem calcas!”*<sup>\*</sup> Here, the traveler does not see just a humble hero scattered through ancestral, almost recent history, but rather the necropolises of the Heroic Ages and, even more, the Metropolises of the Patriarchal Cycles lying beneath his feet.

When Philip of Macedon responded with gentle irony to the Peloponnesian ambassadors’ arrogance: *“How many true Greeks are among you?”* he gave them, without their realizing it, a slight history lesson, knowing better than they that the Graii, the totemists of Gruya, were Celta-Slavic Epirotes and that ancient Greece itself was Slavic and Pelasgic until the invasion by the Asian and Ionian revolutionary exploiters: the Yonijas and Yavanas of Manu, the Yavanim of Moses. A Larto of Etruria and a Numa could likewise have said to the Levantines of the Tiber: *“How many true Italians are among you?”*

Indeed, the true Greeks were Balkan Slavs; the true Italians were Celta-Slavs who had descended from the western and eastern Alpine mountains. They were all part of the immense confederation of the Pelasgi of Harakala, and before that, of Rama of Moses and the Brahmans—Bacchus of the Greco-Latins—and still earlier of the first Patriarchal Cycle.

These masters of rivers, seas, flooded lands—those tamers of animals and wild nature—were priests, scholars, military engineers, farmers, and city founders such as the world has not seen since.

The Aryas<sup>5</sup>, grouped in dodecapolis, stretched from Italy to Greece, from the Balkans to the Caucasus, from the Tauric lands to the plains of Tartary, from the Iran of the Ghiborim to the Hebyreh of the Nephilim<sup>\*</sup> and all of Aryavarta<sup>\*\*</sup>.

*“Oh Hebyreh, dwelling of the pure law in Aryavarta.”* Thus spoke the first Zoroaster<sup>6</sup>, 28 centuries before our era, 12 centuries before Moses. The latter accurately quotes Heber of Hebyreh, mentioning him in his lineage among the patriarchs who regard as ancestors the Hyksos—those whom Manetho calls outcasts of Egypt. The Brahmans, as far as India is concerned, say the same thing as Manetho does, but it is Zoroaster who explains it all.

Only in Italy can we name the Metropolises of these city-zodiacs, these Argytas, grand and beautiful as Thebes and Memphis, as ancient as Babylon and Nineveh, testifying to the same science that illuminates the northern Indian university cities such as Kaçi, beloved of the Chaldeans, and Tirohita, cherished by the Egyptian priests. Thus, in Europe itself, pre-diluvian social decline falls like a thicker veil, until the coming of the Redeemer.

But, if we lift it fold by fold, the veil torn by Jesus—the Incarnate Verb—softens, allowing the primordial civilization’s light to be revealed and then to glow: the universal Empire of the Aryas and Rutas<sup>7</sup>, the Indo-European and Egyptian Theocracy of Ishva-Ra and OshiRi, of Jesus, the Creative Verb; *Jesus Rex patriarcarum*, as rightly proclaimed by our litanies.

*“In the beginning was the Verb,”* says the disciple whom Jesus loved and from whom the Master withheld nothing. One cannot more clearly fix the Cycle of the governmental proto-synthesis, the primordial age in which the Creative Verb, worshiped under its true name, was prophesied as the Incarnate Verb, as the Savior of the fallen social State.

When the Mediterranean Paganism—the sabbath of slave-owning bourgeois— occurred, it was the regular Societies of Europe, Asia, Africa, their Universities, their Temples that did not cease protesting against the Sophists, the false democrats, the politicians, and the rhetoricians who rebelled against any order and every social peace.

Rome and Athens were banished from Humanity—like Babylon, Tyre, and all the intellectual and moral rot of Ionia.

Celtic-Cimmerian Druths, Celtic-Slavic Droths, Scandinavian Volas, Germanic Vellés, Lartos of Italy and Iberia, Prophets of Egypt, Nabis of Israel, Magi of Persia and Chaldea, Manavic Brathmas, Vedic Rishis, Tibetan Lamas, Tartar and Mongolian Shamans—everywhere the same anathema against Edom<sup>8</sup> and the Yavan of Moses, against the Yavanas and the Mlektas of Manu<sup>9</sup>.

If Alexander the Great had not destroyed so many sacred Mazdeist works, truth and philosophy would have pointed him out in the annals of History with the title “the Great Vandal.”

Finally, there rises the justiciar of the North, the great Ase<sup>10</sup> of Asgard<sup>11</sup>, Frighe son of Fridolf, and with him roars the centuries-long fury of peoples. Half-druid and half-buddhist, Wodan is raised upon his *Pavise*<sup>12</sup>, armed with the twelve swords of his Apostles. He takes on the name of the Boreal Trismegistus to rally beneath his militant divinity all of Northern, Central, Eastern Europe and its reserves: Og, Gog, and Magog, to the very heart of High Asia.

Then, that multitude of men slowly crowds together and rolls over Satan’s civilization. Fulfilling Christ’s prophecy, Pagan Rome, unknowingly, avenges Heaven by devouring Jerusalem; Europe avenges the Earth by surrendering an emptied Rome to the Pontiffs of Jesus Christ.

Byzantium remains, where all the pestilences of Rome and Athens had merged to corrupt the Barbarians and the Christians. Then, the Southern Wodan arises, and Mohammed resounds the Qur’an, the Sunna, and the Djehad through the human trumpets of Islam. What the race of snow could not complete is accomplished by the race of fire and coal: Arabs, Turanians, Turkomans, and Ottomans.

Modern Europe suffers the same destinies. It provokes them all at once, when it trades the Living Spirit for the Dead Spirit, the Christian Spirit for the Pagan.

And if human powers are insufficient to lead it back to its Principle, Jehovah will unleash the powers of the elements upon this new Adamah and its Atlantis.

Willingly or by force, through the Son or through the Father, Christendom will return to the Holy Spirit.

Six centuries before Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the somber darkness of Mediterranean Paganism that followed the celestial brightness of the Orphic synthesis<sup>13</sup>, in the anarchic period that followed the revolution of the *sudras*<sup>14</sup> on behalf of the slave-owning bourgeoisie and the agnostic clergy—there emerged, in the full stature of an *Epopt*, a man, Pythagoras, reminiscent of a patriarch from the Old Testament, who deserves far more than all that has been said about him. For this reason, we mention him at the heading of this book, intended to prepare the mind and understanding for the use of the precision instrument that makes experimental the Universal Revelation of the Verb, Divine Wisdom.

This occurs about 25 centuries before our time, at a moment when the European mentality bears a remarkable resemblance to that of Pythagoras. When he embarks upon his Mission in Europe, the Orphic synthesis of the patriarchal or verbal proto-synthesis had nearly vanished, drowned by the invading wave of Paganism from Asian and Ionian literati. In the same way, in our day, Christianity—blurred since its concordat in the fourth century and completely deprived of its supremacy since the Renaissance—cedes ground everywhere to neo-pagan Humanism.

Pythagoras, his time, his work, and his conclusions offer us a solid basis for the study we undertake and for presenting the scientific means to be used to raise the fallen social State and restore the synthesis that the great philosopher vainly tried to reconstitute.

Now then, since our twentieth year, we have resolved to become the Pythagoras of Christianity—supplanted since the Renaissance by the pagan spirit. Hence, twenty years later, our four missions among modern pagans, and our actions in Paris, Brussels, Rome, and elsewhere, and in this testimony of truth, we rely only on God and on His field aid: time.

And now, in our old age, casting a retrospective glance on the long path of our duty fulfilled, we see, with great peace of mind and conscience, that we have not deviated from Truth in our books, nor in our public or private actions. It floats above ignorance and calumny, higher than contempt— as lofty as divine mercy for those miserable blind souls led blindfolded into the human Hell that will swallow them up.

It is this same charity that, despite the cruelest of bereavements, old age, and illness, drives us to complete this work, whose composition was promised to the divine Master and carried out with His help.

The glory of this belongs solely to Jesus Christ, and in Him, to His Angelic Soul that united us and wished that even death should not separate us. Thus, before we have the indescribable joy of stamping our *carte de visite* upon this planet with “P. P. C.,” we are happy to greet the illustrious memory of Pythagoras with the same respect we held for him in our youth.

5. **Arya** (Sansk.):  
   Meaning “holy” or “noble” as a reference to a noble lineage. The name of the race (Aryan) that invaded India in the Vedic period. It became an epithet for a race, and our orientalists, depriving the Hindu Brahmans of their origin, made Europeans into Aryas. In Esotericism, the four Aryas—paths or stages of spiritual development (the “four fruits” that lead to the state of Arhat)—are:  
   - **Zrotapatti** (he who has entered the stream)  
   - **akrídagamin** (who must return to life only once)  
   - **Anagamin** (who must not return to life)  
   - **Arhat** (venerable, the fourth degree of perfection)  

   Thus, they are the four classes corresponding to those four paths and truths.

6. **Zoroaster** (Greek version of “Zarathustra” (Zend)):  
   A great lawgiver and founder of the religion known as Mazdeism, Magism, or Parsism—the Cult of Fire and the immanent forces of the Sun, represented by the god Mithra. The date of the last Zoroaster is unknown, and perhaps for this reason, Xanthus of Lydia, the first Greek writer to mention this great legislator and religious reformer, places him about 600 years before the Trojan War—also an uncertain date. Aristotle and Eudoxus place him no fewer than 6,000 years before the days of Plato, and Aristotle did not make statements without a firm basis. Berossus said he was king of Babylon around 2200 BC; however, we cannot be certain of his original sources since, if they were the manuscripts of Eusebius, the latter frequently altered dates in both the Egyptian synchronous tables and the Chaldean chronology. Haug assigns no less than 1000 BC as Zoroaster’s antiquity. Bunsen (<em>God in History</em>, vol. I, book III, ch. VI, p. 276) states that Zarathustra Spitama lived in the time of King Vishtaspa, or 3000 years before our era, and describes him as “one of the most powerful intelligences and one of the greatest men of all time.” Given the above dates and the extinction of the Zend language, whose main knowledge was translated into Pahlavi (which, according to Darmosteter, fell out of use in the Sassanid era), our scholars and orientalists set on their own a hypothetical date for the age of the holy prophet Zurthust. However, the records of Occult Wisdom give the precise dates of the thirteen Zoroasters mentioned in the <em>Dabistan</em>. Their teachings, especially those of the last (divine) Zoroaster, spread from Bactria to the Medes and from there, under the name of Magism, were embraced by Chaldean astronomer-adepts, influencing the mystical teachings of Mosaic doctrines, although it may have been the theological foundation of the modern Parsees’ religion. Like Manu and Vyasa in India, Zaratustra is a generic name for the great reformers and lawgivers of antiquity. The hierarchy began with the divine Zaratustra in the <em>Vendidad</em> and ended with the great but mortal man bearing that title, who is lost to history. As shown in the <em>Dabistan</em>, there were many Zoroasters or Zarathustras. According to H.P. Blavatsky in her <em>Secret Doctrine</em>, vol. II, the last Zoroaster was the founder of the Fire Temple of Azarcksh, many centuries prior to the historical records.

7. **Ruta(s)** (Sansk.):  
   The name of one of the last islands of Atlantis, destroyed centuries before Poseidonia, Plato’s “Atlantis.” (In Sanskrit, “ruta” also means “cry.”) An ancient people who inhabited the island of Ruta located on a continent in the Pacific Ocean.

8. **Edom** (Heb.):  
   The Edomite kings can represent the Root Races—a hidden allegory in the mention of “the kings who reigned in the land of Edom, before any king reigned over the sons of Israel” (Genesis 36:31). Kabbalah teaches that this kingdom was unstable because “the forces were unbalanced.” The world of Israel is an image of the condition of worlds that came into being subsequent to the period following the establishment of balance. On the other hand, Eastern esoteric philosophy teaches that the seven Kings of Edom are not an image of perished worlds or unbalanced forces, but a symbol of the seven Root Races of humanity, four of which have disappeared, the fifth we are passing through, and the last two are yet to come. In the occult language, the esoteric veils indicate—as shown in John’s *Apocalypse*, ch. 17:10—“And there are seven kings; five have fallen, and one (the fifth race) remains, and the other (the sixth Root Race) has not yet come…” If all seven Edomite kings had perished as worlds of “unbalanced forces,” the fifth and the others yet to come could not exist. In the *Revealed Kabbalah*, we read: “The seven Kings died, and their possessions were destroyed,” and a footnote restates the observation, saying: “These seven Kings are the Edomite kings.”

9. **Manu** (Sansk.):  
   A great Hindu lawgiver. The name derives from the Sanskrit root “man” (“to think”) relating to humanity, but strictly it means *Swayambhuva*, the first of the Manus who arose from *Swayambhu*, “the self-existent” (the Logos or progenitor of humanity). The Code or Book of Laws of Manu (*Manava-Dharma-Shastra*) is ascribed to this great lawgiver, to whom was given the name Manu Swayambhuva to distinguish him from other Manus.

10. **Ash** (Heb.):  
    Physical or symbolic fire. This word may appear in various forms: Ase, As, Aish, and Esch.

11. **Asgard** (Scandinavian):  
    The dwelling or realm of the Scandinavian gods, located “above the dwelling of the Light Elves,” yet on the same plane as Jotunheim, the home of the Jotuns, malicious giants skilled in magic, with whom the gods were in constant conflict. The gods of Asgard are equivalent to the Suras (Hindu gods), and the Jotuns are equivalent to the Asuras. They are also akin to the Greek gods and Titans, representing the beneficial and malevolent powers of nature’s forces.

12. **Pavise**:  
    A large, broad shield covering the soldier’s entire body. A banner, a pennant.

13. **Orpheus** (Greek: *Orpheus* = “Dark”):  
    In mythology, he is the son of Oeagrus and the muse Calliope. Esoteric tradition identifies him with Arjuna (the son of Indra and mystical disciple of Krishna). He traveled the world establishing mysteries and teaching nations wisdom and the sciences. According to legend, Orpheus lost his wife Eurydice and found her in Hades [the underworld], akin to Arjuna’s journey to Patala (Hades or hell, but actually the antipodes or America) where he married Ulûpî, daughter of King Nâga. Orpheus was dark-skinned; the Greeks said they never had very fair skin. We know from Herodotus that Orpheus brought his Mysteries from India, and according to official scholarship, they predate the Chaldeans and the Egyptians. It is further known that, at the time of Pausanias, there was a priestly family which—like the Brahmans did with the Vedas—transmitted all the Orphic Hymns orally, from generation to generation, trusting the neophyte’s memory (<em>Secret Doctrine</em>, III, 297). Orpheus was a virtuoso musician who played a “cithara” received from the gods, to which he added two strings to the seven it already had. He was so skillful with his lyre that his chords tamed wild beasts. He practiced strict vegetarianism, living an entirely meatless life. Among the earliest Christian monuments, one sometimes finds Orpheus surrounded by both feral and domestic animals, placed among the prophets and saints, all drawn by the sound of his lyre. In the early days of Christianity, the illustrious singer of Thrace was an object of singular veneration and even worship by the Church Fathers themselves (Martigny, <em>Dict. des antiq. Chrét.</em>).

14. **Shûdra** or **Súdra** or **S’udra** (Sansk.):  
    The “servant caste,” which arose from the Divinity’s foot. [Servant, menial; an individual of the fourth, lowest class engaged in servitude and the basest occupations.] The last of the four castes that emerged from the body of Brahmâ.
